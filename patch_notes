commit 12

got the concurrency thing working. 
created StartUpdate.sql stored procedure to check if timeframe has passed since last update and whether someone is currently updating db (flag)
	if (yes, no), flags and returns true, else returns false
	Concurrency - I did research. Because the procedure uses update in 1 line, only one call will return true.
		because it flags in the same line where it checks. atomic
updatedb.py now calls this procedure to see if it needs to execute itself. calling gameover works. calling weekover works
